Description: "Tumor staging is the process of determining the extent of a cancer's spread from the original site of the tumor to other parts of the body. The staging system used most often in the United States is the TNM system. The T stands for tumor, the N stands for nodes, and the M stands for metastasis. The T describes the size and extent of the primary tumor. The N describes the size and extent of the lymph nodes involved. The M describes whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The TNM system is used to stage many types of cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. The TNM system is also used to stage other types of cancer, such as melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia. The TNM system is used to stage many types of cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer.
